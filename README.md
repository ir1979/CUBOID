# CUBOID
Anomaly detection based on clustering representation
=======

CUBOID is a time series anomaly detection Python program that comprises three modules:

1- a data representation module,

2- an anomaly modeling module,

3- an anomaly detection module.

In the data representation module, the program employs a clustering algorithm to represent time series.
CUBOID was proposed in a research paper titled "Time Series Anomaly Detection via Clustering-based Representation," which was submitted to the Evolving System Journal.
